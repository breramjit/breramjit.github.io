    <h3>about me</h3>
    <p>
        hello! my name is <strong>bre ramjit</strong> and i am 
        a 1<sup>st</sup> year student at algonquin for the <abbr title="interactive media design">IMD</abbr>
        program. i have just recently graduated from <em>western university</em>
        with a degree in criminology. i am interested in learning new skills from the
        <abbr title="interactive media design">IMD</abbr> program so that i can hopefully
        pursue a career in graphic design and freelance photography.
    </p>
    <p>
        in my free time i enjoy both baking sweets and cooking meals. i <strong>love</strong>
        trying new recipes whenever i can. further, i enjoy watercolour 
        painting and making beaded jewelry, in fact i recently opened an 
        <em>Etsy</em> shop where i sell both my paintings and jewelry. i also
        enjoy watching movies and my ideal idea of relaxing would be going to 
        the movie theatre on my own or with my friends.
