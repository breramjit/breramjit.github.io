    <p>
        Hello! My name is <strong>Bre Ramjit</strong> and I am 
        a 1<sup>st</sup> year student at Algonquin for the <abbr title="interactive media design">IMD</abbr> program. I have just recently graduated from <em>Western University</em> with a degree in criminology. I am interested in learning new skills from the <abbr title="interactive media design">IMD</abbr> program so that I can hopefully pursue a career in graphic design and freelance photography.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my free time I enjoy both baking sweets and cooking meals. I <strong>love</strong> trying new recipes whenever I can. Further, I enjoy watercolour painting and making beaded jewelry, in fact I recently opened an <em>Etsy</em> shop where I sell both my paintings and jewelry. I also enjoy watching movies and my ideal idea of relaxing would be going to the movie theatre on my own or with my friends.
